# Project: Arcade Game Clone - Shannon Clark

This is a project developed as part of Udacity's [Front-end developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). The aim of this project is to create a clone of the classic arcade game Frogger using the HTML5 canvas API and object-oriented javascript code.

The project is hosted [here](http://shannonclark.me/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/).

## Getting Started
First you'll need to download the project by cloning the git repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/theshannonclark/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game.git game
```

Then change into the project directory with `cd game`.

Finally open `index.html` in your web browser.

## How to Play the Game

You can move the character around using the arrow keys. Move up while avoiding enemies until you reach a tile with a star icon. Step on that tile to complete the level.
